  Behavior-driven design: write executable specifications BEFORE any
  implementation code. Reads /docs/PLAN.md for the build plan and
  /docs/STORIES.md for user stories, and stops to ask for either if it is
  missing. Generates TypeScript spec files in nested blocks — Feature >
  Scenario > Specification — where each Scenario arranges all of its data
  in a beforeAll/beforeEach, every Specification makes exactly one
  assertion, happy-path specs come first and exhaustively, and sad-path
  specs live in their own separate blocks. Auto-detects the runner: Vitest.
  Use when starting a new project or feature, when asked to "spec out",
  "write the tests first", do BDD/TDD, or turn a plan or user stories into
  a test suite. Ships PLAN.md and STORIES.md scaffolds plus a ready-to-copy
  Vitest spec template.

# Behavior-Driven Design — Specifications First

Specifications are written **before** implementation. The spec is the design artifact: it encodes the intended behavior from the plan and the user stories, fails first, and is the definition of done. Do not write implementation code under this skill until the specs exist and the user has seen them.

## 🎯 Why: Design for Change

The goal of writing software is to be able to **change it safely**. Specs are the safety net that makes change possible — without them, every edit is a guess. One assertion per Specification means a failing spec names exactly what broke; happy/sad-path separation means you can change one behavior without re-reading the whole suite. The spec suite *is* the change-budget for the codebase.

## The non-negotiable workflow

Run these gates **in order**. Do not skip ahead.

### 1. Require the plan

Look for the build plan at `/docs/PLAN.md` (also accept
`docs/PLAN.md`, `PLAN.md`, or an obvious `docs/plan.*`).

- **If it is missing:** stop. Ask the user to provide a `PLAN.md` in `/docs`. Offer to scaffold one from `assets/PLAN.md` and let them fill it in, or to draft it from their description and write it to `/docs/PLAN.md` for approval. Do not proceed to specs without an approved plan.
- **If it exists:** read it fully. It defines the features and the technical boundaries the specs must cover.

### 2. Require the user stories

Look for user stories at `/docs/STORIES.md` (also accept `docs/STORIES.md`, `STORIES.md`).

- **If it is missing:** stop. Ask the user for the user stories. Offer to scaffold `assets/STORIES.md`, or to derive draft stories from `PLAN.md` and write them to `/docs/STORIES.md` for approval. Do not proceed without stories — they are the source of every Scenario.
- **If it exists:** read it fully. Each story maps to one Feature; each acceptance criterion / "so that" outcome maps to a Scenario.

### 3. Detect the test runner

The project uses Vitest. Import from `"vitest"` (Jest-compatible API: `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeAll`, etc.). Run with the project's `test` script (e.g. `pnpm test`). If vitest is not installed, stop and prompt the user to install it first (`pnpm install -D vitest`).

### 4. Generate the specs

For every story, produce a spec file built from the templates. Map stories to features 1:1, write the file, then stop and let the user review before any implementation.

## The spec structure (mandatory shape)

Three nested blocks, outer to inner: **Feature → Scenario → Specification**.

```ts
describe("Feature: <name from a user story>", () => {
  describe("Scenario: <a concrete situation / acceptance criterion>", () => {
    // Arrange ALL data this scenario needs, once, here:
    let result: Cart;
    beforeAll(() => {
      const cart = new Cart();
      cart.add(item("widget", 2));
      result = cart;
    });

    // Specification = one `it` = exactly ONE assertion:
    it("has two line items", () => {
      expect(result.lineItems).toHaveLength(2);
    });

    it("totals the line items", () => {
      expect(result.total).toBe(20);
    });
  });
});
```

Hard rules — every generated file must obey all of them:

1. **Feature** is the outermost `describe`, titled `Feature: …` with a short human-readable name — **no story id in the title**. One feature per file, sourced from a user story. The file name is a readable kebab-case slug of the feature, also without a story-id prefix (e.g. `atomic-create-user-order-entitlements.spec.ts`). Put the story id in a single comment at the top of the file (e.g. `// STORY-007 — Atomic create of user, order, entitlements`) — that comment is the only place the id appears.
2. **Scenario** is a nested `describe`, titled `Scenario: …`. Every Scenario arranges **all** of its required data in a `beforeAll` (use `beforeEach` only if a spec mutates shared state). No arrange logic inside the `it` blocks.
3. **Specification** is an `it`. **Exactly one assertion per `it`.** No multiple `expect`s, no looped assertions. Need another assertion → another `it`.
4. **Happy path first, and exhaustive.** Cover every success outcome the story implies before any failure case. Be thorough, not minimal.
5. **Sad path is segregated.** Error, validation, and edge-case specs go in their own separate Scenario block(s) (e.g. `Scenario: rejecting invalid input`) — never interleaved with happy-path specs.
6. **TypeScript**, typed, no `any`. Imports come from the detected runner only.
7. **At least one Scenario per Feature exercises the deployed entry point.** Import the production export — the exported handler, `default.fetch`, the Hono app, the Next route file — not an internal function bypassing it. Drive side effects through fake **adapters** injected at the boundary (fake DB, fake email, fake storage), never by calling internals. If the only way to test a Feature is to bypass the export, the export is the bug. Unit-seam specs are fine *in addition*, but never *instead*. Mocks define test reality; only the entry-point spec defines production reality.

## Templates

Copy the file that matches the detected runner and adapt it — do not hand-write the scaffold:

- `assets/feature.vitest.spec.ts` — Vitest spec, full Feature/Scenario/Specification shape with happy + segregated sad paths.
- `assets/PLAN.md` — build-plan scaffold to hand the user when `/docs/PLAN.md` is missing.
- `assets/STORIES.md` — user-story scaffold (story + acceptance criteria) to hand the user when `/docs/STORIES.md` is missing.

See `references/workflow.md` for the story→feature→scenario mapping worked through end to end, and the exhaustiveness checklist.
